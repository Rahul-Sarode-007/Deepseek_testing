## ðŸ¤– Built with AI â€“ Powered by DeepSeek

This project was initially generated using **[DeepSeek Developer](https://deepseek.com)** â€” an advanced AI tool that converts plain English prompts into full-stack application code.

Using just one prompt, DeepSeek produced a fully functional React + Tailwind CSS layout, which I then customized to enhance the look and feel, improve responsiveness, and polish the UI.

### ðŸ§  Prompt Used to Generate This Site:

Design a visually stunning portfolio website for a freelance web designer named Sarah. The UI must look premium and modern â€” similar to top Dribbble portfolios.

Include:

Hero section with full-screen gradient or image background, Sarah's name in bold typography, animated tagline (like typing or fade-in), and a call-to-action button

Sticky glassmorphic navbar with logo and smooth scroll

Dark/light mode toggle in navbar

About section with profile image, elegant typography, and a toggle to expand full story

Services section with animated cards (Web Design, UI/UX, SEO) that lift slightly on hover, use colorful vector icons

Portfolio gallery in a Masonry layout with filters and subtle hover effects on images

Testimonials carousel with round profile pictures and quote icons

Contact form with floating labels and live validation

Footer with social icons, minimal dark theme, and newsletter subscription field

Use modern fonts, pastel or vibrant gradients, soft shadows, rounded corners, and Tailwind CSS + React.

It should look impressive enough that a company like Adobe, Apple, or Google would want to hire her just by seeing the design.
